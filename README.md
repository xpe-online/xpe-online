### Something About Me
#### 关于我的一些事
- xpe is sometimes called "Little CnH<sub>2</sub>n Sauce"(Sauce here means "ちゃん" in Japanese, read as "Chan").In Chinese Pinyin, it reads as "Xiǎo Xī Jiàng".
 
  xpe有时被称为"小烯酱"（这里的酱代指日语中"ちゃん"的意思,详见 [百度百科](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%85%B1/18052177)上的介绍 （当然意思不大一样））
